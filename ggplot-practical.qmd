## Aims
> This practical aims at performing exploratory plots and how-to build layer by layer to be familiar with the grammar of graphics. 

## Scatter plots of penguins

The `penguins` dataset is provided by the `palmerpenguins` R package. As for every function, most data-sets shipped with a package contain also a useful help page (`?`).

##### If not done already, install the package `palmerpenguins` load it and add it to your `renv.lock` file

```{r}
# Write your answer here
```


```{r}
# Write your answer here
```



##### Plot the body mass on the _y_ axis and the bill length on the _x_ axis and colour by `species`

```{r}
# Write your answer here
```




##### The `geom_smooth()` layer can be used to add a trend line. Try to overlay it to your scatter plot.

```{block, opts.label = "tip"}
by default `geom_smooth` is using a loess regression (< 1,000 points) and adds standard error intervals. 

- The `method` argument can be used to change the regression to a linear one: `method = "lm"`
- to disable the ribbon of standard errors, set `se = FALSE`

Be careful where the aesthetics are located, so the trend linear lines are **also** colored per species.
```

```{r}
# Write your answer here
```



##### Adjust the aesthetics of point in order to

- the `shape` map to the originated `island`
- a fixed size of `5`
- a transparency of 30%

```{block,  opts.label = "tip"}
You should still have only 3 coloured linear trend lines. Otherwise check to which layer your are adding the aesthetic `shape`.

Remember that fixed parameters are to be defined outside `aes()`.

Be careful with tab-completion. The column you want to work with is called `island` (singular) but there is also a built-in data frame calles `islands` (plural) that has nothing to do with penguins data set.
```

```{r}
# Write your answer here
```


##### Adjust the colour aesthetic to the `ggplot()` call to propagate it to both point and regression line.
Try the scale colour viridis for discrete scale (`scale_colour_viridis_d()`). Try to change the default theme to `theme_bw()`

```{r}
# Write your answer here
```


##### Find a way to produce the following plot:


![](img/penguins_viridis.png)
```{r}
# Write your answer here
```

::: {.callout-tip icon="false"}
### Tip

Remember that:

- all aesthetics defined in the `ggplot(aes())` command will be inherited by all following layers
- `aes()` of individual geoms are specific (and overwrite the global definition if present).
- `labs()` controls of plot annotations
- `theme()` allows to tweak the plot like `theme(plot.caption = element_text(face = "italic"))` to render in italic the caption
